Tested for startup and shutdown on Windows XP, Windows Vista (?) and Windows 7.

Supported projectors:
- NEC NP1150
- Projection Design F30
- Hitachi Cp-a100

Versions of JSC
v1.0 - Used from Vitenfabrikkens opening in may 2008 to jan 2011. Turned on and off most of the exhibitions.
v1.1 - Improved handling of projectors. PD F30 introduced. Better status handling. Also a lot of cleanup of the codebase.
v1.2 - New main interface. Includes only button for turning on/off some selected groups and status for those groups.
v1.2.2 - When turning on/off a group from main window, there can be displayed a message. Can also disable turn on/off for a group in main window. Also added logging of communications.
v1.2.3 - Bug fix for NEC projectors. The projectors sometimes return no status and this made the program display the projector with an error. 
v1.2.4 - Detailed view of machine, projectors, etc. Turn on/off Hitachi Cp-a100 is supported.
v1.2.5 - Projection Design F20 is tested. Bug fix for groups.conf reader so that PD projectors har parsed correctly

## How it works ##
- Client software (jsc_systray) runs on all computers we want controll over
- The client software knows its name, its mac-address and what server to connect to
- Client machine has has wake on lan (WOL) enabled
- Client software connects to the server (jsc_server running on another computer)
- Each time the client connects to server, the server saves status to XML file
- If the server doesn't know the client, it creates a XML file for it and saves the settings.  
- JSC_controller is refreshing the files each 60 seconds to update the interface
- JSC_controller communicates directly with the projectors.

## Group config - groups.conf ##

Example:
[Groupname]
00:00:00:00:00:00

[Next group]
00:00:00:00:00:00
projectorNEC Projectorname
projectorPD Projectorname2
00:00:00:00:00:00

[Group in mainwindow]
mainwindow
00:00:00:00:00:00
00:00:00:00:00:00

[Group without shutdown and wakeup]
shutdown_msg This group can not be shut down
shutdown_disabled
wakeup_msg No wakeup
wakeup_disabled

etc.

## Making / Deploying a new version of JSC ##

- Commit your changes to the Git repository
- Make the JAR file (export to JAR in Eclipse) and put it in the "jar" folder
- Add a line in README (This file) about the new version (there is a list of version and what the changes where)
- Commit the JAR file and the new README to repo with the message "Version X.Y.Z"
- Open Git bash and run the following command:
	git tag -m "Version X.Y.Z" vX.Y.Z
- Open Git Gui and push to origin including tags (a little checkbox you have to check)
- Go to the machine running JSC and download the JAR file from Github
