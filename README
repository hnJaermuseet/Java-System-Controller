Tested for startup and shutdown on Windows XP, Windows Vista (?) and Windows 7.

Supported projectors:
- NEC NP1150
- Projection Design F30

Versions of JSC
v1.0 - Used from Vitenfabrikkens opening in may 2008 to jan 2011. Turned on and off most of the exhibitions.
v1.1 - Improved handling of projectors. PD F30 introduced. Better status handling. Also a lot of cleanup of the codebase.

## How it works ##
- Client software (jsc_systray) runs on all computers we want controll over
- The client software knows its name, its mac-address and what server to connect to
- Client machine has has wake on lan (WOL) enabled
- Client software connects to the server (jsc_server running on another computer)
- Each time the client connects to server, the server saves status to XML file
- If the server doesn't know the client, it creates a XML file for it and saves the settings.  
- JSC_controller is refreshing the files each 60 seconds to update the interface
- JSC_controller communicates directly with the projectors.
